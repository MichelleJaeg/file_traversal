Overview:

Program should go through a database table ("paths") of paths (such as home/Bob/Projects), and for each
path, each file found on this path should be in another table called "location". The program
should report on files that are new, modified, or deleted, and "location" should be updated
accordingly.

pseudocode:

Assume table called "paths" is already created

Connect to database
Create table called "location", if not already created

for each path in paths:
    for each file in the path:
        Obtain information about file and add to "location" or update information
        Add file to list deleted, modified, or new file (or none) as appropriate

print out files that are new
print out files that have been modified
print out files that have been deleted
